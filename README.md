# InSquareMatrix
Program that takes a matrix in which the elements in each row are increasing in value from left to right and elements in each column are increasing in value from top to bottom and an integer and returns and “true” if this this number is in the matrix and “false” otherwise. The implementation has a O(n) running time complexity where n represents the dimensions of the square matrix. Testing report and sample matrices are also implemented to demonstrate the linear time complexity of this matrix search algorithm.
